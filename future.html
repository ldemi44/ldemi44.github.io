			<p>Although there is no way for sure to predict what will happen in the future in terms of population shifts, we do know that people will continue to migrate from northern states to southern states because the south offers better job oppportunities and more pro-business policies which incentivize businesses to relocate there.</p>
			<p>Florida and Texas will most likely continue to gain massive amounts of residents until the housing prices become entirely unaffordable, causing the Florida and Texas migration to become stagnate. Arizona will similarly continue to attract California residents and will most likely be able to attract even more residents than Florida and Texas because Arizona has way more opportunity to grow and expand. Georgia and North Carolina will also attract northerners but not at the same rate as states like Texas, Florida, and Arizona, simply because those states have more name recognition and new opportunity.</p>
			<p>California and New York will most likely continue to hemorrhage people at a ridiculous rate, while Louisiana will lose many more residents but the bleeding will eventually stop. Pennsylvania and Illinois will likely lose residents but not nearly as fast of a rate as they were during the COVID years, most likely about 10,000 residents a year.</p>
			<p>In my personal opinion, I strongly believe that the top gaining states in the future will be places like Montana, Idaho, South Dakota, and Kansas. These midwest states are already starting to grow at an enormous rate relative to their population size, but since their population sizes are so small it seems insignificant. For example, Idaho increased their population size by 1.8%, only behind Florida's gain of 1.9%. As urban areas in these states become more prosperous and greater economic activity expands to these regions, there will be a mass exodus to find new employment in these states. These states also have large, growing suburbs and very pro-business policies that would convince larger companies to relocate there, but they just don't have the people yet. The midwest also has some of the best scenery and wildlife, and their environment is relatively clean and healthy.</p>

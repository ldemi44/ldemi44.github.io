			<p>Throughout the COVID Pandemic, many states experienced drastic population shifts and mass migration movements to other states. Whether these movements were because of political affiliation, lack of jobs, or just wanting to move to places with better weather, the United States saw a migration from populous democratic states to more southern republican states. The Graph above highlights in Red the states that experienced a large exodus of their former residents while the states in Blue experienced a sudden wave of new residents looking for a place to live. According to the Brookings Institution, from 2021 to 2022, 9% of Americans moved to a new place. Even though not all of these internal movements moved across state lines, a fairly decent amount of them still decided to pack everything up and leave, each with their own unique reason why.</p>
			
			<p>Some of the top changing population states include:</p>
			<ul>	
				<li>Texas</li>
				<li>Florida</li>
				<li>Arizona</li>
				<li>Pennsylvania</li>
				<li>North Carolina</li>

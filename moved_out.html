				<h1>New York</h1>
				<img class="states" src="images/newyork.png" alt="New York">
				<p>Mostly because of their horrendous COVID policies, New York has been hemorrhaging residents for the last few years. According to recent data, from July 1, 2021 to July 1, 2022 alone, New York alone lost over 180,000 residents to other states. New York also has some of the highest living costs and taxes in the country which makes it unlivable for the average person. People from New York have mostly fled to Texas and Florida to explore new job opportunities and avoid high costs of living and taxes. Some other reasons that New York is losing residents are: </p>
				<ul>
					<li>Spiking Crime Rates</li>
					<li>Increasing Government Regulation</li>
					<li>Anti-Business Policies</li>
					<li>Unavailable Housing</li>
				</ul>

				<h1>California</h1>
				<img class="states" src="images/california.png" alt="California">
				<p>Similarly to New York, California also enacted horrible COVID policies that caused a mass exodus of California citizens to states like Arizona, Idaho, Texas, and Florida. In the last two years, roughly 500,000 California residents left the state because of poor life quality in California. California, like New York, has perhaps the highest living costs and taxes of any state in the nation, which make it unlivable for the average person. California's leftist policies also scare people away from their state because less people feel less safe in California. Some other reasons that California is losing residents are: </p>
				<ul>
					<li>Spiking Crime Rates</li>
					<li>Extreme Rioting/Looting</li>
					<li>Anti-Business Policies</li>
					<li>Unaffordable Housing</li>
					<li>Homelessness</li>
					<li>Opioid Crisis</li>
					<li>Border Crisis</li>
					<li>Tech Industry Job Layoffs</li>

				<h1>Louisiana</h1>
				<img class="states" src="images/louisiana.png" alt="Louisiana">
				<p>Louisiana is perhaps the odd one out on this list because Louisiana is the only republican state on this list, while the rest almost always vote democrat. The reason for this is mostly because Louisiana has a large elderly population, one that severely thinned out during the COVID pandemic. The oil/gas industry in Louisiana also recently lost a lot of its value, and caused a lot of people to search for new jobs in different states. Louisiana also has some of the most unsafe cities in the world, and have caused citizens to flee to safer areas. According to recent data, from July 1, 2021 to July 1, 2022 alone, Louisiana lost over 36,000 residents to other states. Some other reasons that Louisiana is losing residents are:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Natural Disasters/Hurricanes</li>
					<li>Loss of Job Opportunities</li>
					<li>Violent Crime</li>
					<li>Poor Living Conditions</li>
					<li>Poor Education</li>
				</ul>

				<h1>Pennsylvania</h1>
				<img class="states" src="images/pennsylvania.png" alt="Pennsylvania">
				<p>Pennsylvania only barely makes this list, mostly because of declining job opportunities and overall quality of life. Besides the suburban areas of the state, most of Pennsylvania is relatively not well off and have low standards of living. Pennsylvania also has perhaps some of the worst weather out of any of the 50 states. Pennsylvania's weather fluctuates from freezing cold to 80 degree sunny weather in the matter of only a few hours. Also, in terms of COVID policies, although they were not insanely restrictive, they still nudged people the wrong way enough to finally move out of the state and start somewhere else new. According to recent data, from July 1, 2021 to July 1, 2022 alone, Pennsylvania lost over 40,000 residents to other states. Some other reasons that Pennsylvania is losing residents are:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>High Gas Taxes and Expensive Fuel</li>
					<li>High Income Taxes</li>
					<li>Loss of Job Opportunities</li>
					<li>Declining Economic Prosperity</li>
				</ul>

				<h1>Illinois</h1>
				<img class="states" src="images/illinois.png" alt="Illinois">
				<p>Illinois is the top Rust Belt state in terms of losing residents, as many now view Illinois as anti-business and overall unsafe to reside in. The Rust Belt has been declining now for decades because more jobs can now be found down south which is a reversal of a few decades ago. The north used to be the powerhouse of America but this is quickly shifting to the south. Illinois COVID policies were straight up draconian and caused hundreds of thousands of residents to flee the state and find another state that allowed more freedom. Chicago also saw a massive spike in rioting, looting, and violent crime throughout the BLM movement and during the COVID crisis. From July 1, 2021 to July 1, 2022, Illinois lost over 100,000 residents to other states. Some other reasons that Illinois is losing residents are:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>High Income/Overall Taxes</li>
					<li>Massive State Debt</li>
					<li>Poorly Funded Pensions</li>
					<li>Opioid Crisis</li>
					<li>Spiking Crime Rates</li>
				</ul>
